## Meeting Notes

*Feel free to fork and add your own!*

All slides presented are in week_1_slides.pdf.

### Teams

**Neural Network Implementation**
    - Raw DNA to Tensors, What are our options?
    - One Hot encoding (2D)
    - What layers make sense to include?
    - Incorporate more data (mapped TFBS, DNAseI, species relatedness, ect)

**Quality Control Pipeline**
    - Quantify and analyze the input data
    - Are these sequences valid? 
    - Which sequences do we remove?
    - Visualize

**TFBS mapping**
    -  Map all TFBS onto sequence
    -  Visualize TFBS and conservation
    -  Make tools for community

## To do for next week

- Email your team preference
- Give me your github username
- Make a program that reads in the `pdm2_neurogenic.fa` and performs one or all of these tasks:
    -   aligns sequence
    -   turns sequences into a basic python data structure
    -   measures GC content per sequence
