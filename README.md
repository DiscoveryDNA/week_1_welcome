### Teams

**Neural Network Implementation**

- Raw DNA to Tensors, What are our options?
- One Hot encoding (2D)
- What layers make sense to include?
- Incorporate more data (mapped TFBS, DNAseI, species relatedness, ect)

**Quality Control Pipeline**

- Quantify and analyze the input data
- Are these sequences valid? 
- Which sequences do we remove?
- Visualize

**TFBS mapping**

-  Map all TFBS onto sequence
-  Visualize TFBS and conservation
-  Make tools for community

## To do for next week

- Email your team preference
- Give me your github username
- In the folder `fasta_exercise`. Make a program that reads in the `pdm2_neurogenic.fa` and performs one or all of the tasks mentioned below. You can perform in R or Python. When you have a working script, please up load into the 'fasta_exercise' directory.
    -   Make a sequence alignment 
    -   turns sequences into a basic python / R data structure 
    -   measures GC content per sequence
- Keep reading background material
