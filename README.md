- What layers make sense to include?
- Incorporate more data (mapped TFBS, DNAseI, species relatedness, ect)

**Quality Control Pipeline**

- Quantify and analyze the input data
- Are these sequences valid? 
- Which sequences do we remove?
- Visualize

**TFBS mapping**

-  Map all TFBS onto sequence
-  Visualize TFBS and conservation
-  Make tools for community

## To do for next week

- Email your team preference
- Give me your github username
- In the folder `fasta_exercise`. Make a program that reads in the `pdm2_neurogenic.fa` and performs one or all of the tasks mentioned below. You can perform in R or Python. When you have a working script, please up load into the `fasta_exercise` directory. Please fork repo and make pull request to add.

Program Tasks:

-   Make a sequence alignment 
-   turns sequences into a basic python / R data structure 
-   measures GC content per sequence
